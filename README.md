## :dart: About ##

This project is a simple counter, made with HTML, CSS and Javascript that lets you add (+) and subtract (-) numbers, starting from zero. 
The buttons are implemented with Javascript only, and they cannot  let you reach negative numbers. 
The counter, and also the background, are inspired by retro gaming consoles like the Gameboy Color by Nintendo; it has an additional set of red buttons, but they have no specific use.
